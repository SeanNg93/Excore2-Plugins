# Tradie
This plugin is a fork from the original [Tradie](https://github.com/TiuDerca/Tradie), updated to work on PoE2.

Note that even though the plugin is a fork from the original, it has been re-written and the handling of logic has been changed.
Also, there are features that I neither implemented nor plan to implement.
